	      Big data ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) operations typically<br/>involve processing and managing large volumes of data, which requires significant<br/>computing power and energy consumption. The energy-intensive nature of these<br/> operations contributes to a substantial carbon footprint. By implementing<br/> sustainability techniques, such as energy-efficient hardware, virtualization,<br/>and optimized data center infrastructure, SMEs can reduce their energy consumption<br/>and carbon emissions.<br/>
          - As the world focuses on sustainability, achieving net-zero carbon emissions has become a critical goal for businesses.<br/>
          - Address the challenges faced by SMEs in their journey towards net-zero carbon emissions in their ETL operations.<br/>
          - Present a business model known as “Green Economy ETL Systems” that leverages technological innovation to support SMEs in reducing their carbon footprint.
